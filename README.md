#CSS --- MY Site

This is a stylised site I built through some online tutorials using intermediate CSS. Learnt about styling the page better, some typography, color scheme and important CSS properties.
Hosted at *https://nibhrit.github.io/CSS---My-Site/*

Some new things I learned - 

- display property has 4 parts like block, inline etc.
- some are block by default like H1 and p tags. Other elements are therefore blocked on the same line
- span tag can help decorate part of a line or paragraph
- common inline elems - span, img, anchors
- to hide display:none, visibility: hidden
- position : static, relative, absolute, fixed.
- relative positioning is relative to its original position/edges not the screen edges.
- for absolute position, it takes position acc to parent. right: 30px means 30 px from right edge of parent. 
- centering block elements - margin 0 auto 0 auto
- rem: root em. Ignores font size on body/parent, if any
- line-height add space above and below text
- wrapping text around image : using float. We can use clear property if we don't want it to wrap.
